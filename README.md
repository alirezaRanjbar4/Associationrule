# Apriori Association Rule Mining in C#

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the Apriori algorithm for mining association rules from transactional data using C#.
The Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm used in data mining to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules.


 **Frequent Itemset Generation**: Efficiently generates frequent itemsets using the Apriori algorithm.
- **Association Rule Mining**: Extracts high-confidence association rules from the frequent itemsets.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Allows customization of minimum support and confidence thresholds.
- **Recursive Rule Generation**: Utilizes recursive methods to generate all possible association rules for a given itemset.
